To create a website link on GitHub, you can use GitHub Pages, which allows you to host a static website directly from a GitHub repository. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and log in.
Click the "New" button (or "New Repository").
Give your repository a name (e.g., my-website).
Make sure the repository is public if you want others to access the site.
Check the box for Initialize this repository with a README.
Click "Create repository."
2. Add Your Website Files
If you have a static site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), you can upload the files.
If you want to use a tool like Jekyll (supported by GitHub Pages), you can create the necessary files.
You can either:

Upload files manually by clicking on "Upload files" or
Clone the repository locally, add files, and push them:
code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git
cd my-website
# Add your HTML, CSS, JS files here
git add .
git commit -m "Initial website commit"
git push origin main
3. Enable GitHub Pages
Go to the repository’s Settings (click on the "Settings" tab).
Scroll down to the "Pages" section (usually under "Code and automation").
In the "Source" dropdown, select the branch that contains your website files (usually main or master).
If needed, select the root or a folder (such as /docs) where your site files are located.
Click Save.
4. Access Your Website
After enabling GitHub Pages, GitHub will generate a URL for your site. This is typically in the format:
code
https://your-username.github.io/repository-name/
You’ll be able to view your site at this link.
Example
If your GitHub username is john-doe and your repository is my-website, your website will be available at:
code
https://john-doe.github.io/my-website/
5. Custom Domain (Optional)
If you have a custom domain, you can add it in the Custom domain field in the GitHub Pages settings.

That's it! Your website will now be live on GitHub.
